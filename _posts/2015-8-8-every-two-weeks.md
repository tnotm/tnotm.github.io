Do you change passions every week or two?

I literally find something interesting to get into every two weeks.  I get frustrated, sometimes angry, that I don't have enough time to devote to it.  What is really funny about this, is that if I do get enough time, and dig in all the way, days later I drop it.

The feeling is almost an obsession.  I will be pulled into whatever it is so deep, everything else fades away. 

What is this?  Why do I get caught up in random stuff for two weeks and then drop it?  I sometimes pick it back up for another two weeks, sometimes years later, but otherwise it just dies.

So what things do I get pulled into?  What 'things' do I get sucked into?

* Blogging ;)
* LongNow.org
* Matrix.org
* IndieAuth/IndieWeb
* Podcasting
* IPFS
* Dokuwiki
* Linux (Distros/DEs)
* Gaming
* Open Source
* Programming
* Jekyll
* Chrome
* Android
* Speaking

This is just the short list.  I would hope to blog or podcast about each subject at length, but where is the time?  The benefit of this process is that I know an awful lot about lots of things.  The downside is I never become an expert.

A jack of all trades and a master of none.
