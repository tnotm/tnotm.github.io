So I came up with something... A sex toy.  That's right I have invented a new sex toy.  Not the thing I ever thought I would create but I think it is good.  In fact I think it is great.

#### What it is
I call it the One Eyed Monster or O.E.M. for short.  It consists of a ball, at 10 inches in diameter and weighing in at 10 pounds, a penis stroker insert, and finally a dildo or stem as I call it.

This device will allow a man to thrust into it like a stroker, or a woman to use it with a dildo.  The size, weight and shape allow it to be placed anywhere.  You literally fuck it, but it is so simple.  Other 'furniture' or asthetic devices are so big and not very descrete.

#### How it started

Have you ever felt sore the next day after having sex?  I did the other day and that is when this all started.  You see I don't excersise much, if at all, and I was like 'well shit here I am sore so I must have worked out'.  I had started this by trying to put excersise and sex together.

What I came up with was a medicine ball with a [stoker][1] in it.  I thought 'Hey if I were to treat this like excersise and sex then I would get a workout!'.  This was not a bad idea but not a great one either.  I was on my way.

Lori pooh pooh'd this idea quickly stating that 'Women don't want to excersise this way.  I mean naked... no way!'.  I had to start thinking of this in a new way, because I knew I had something.

#### A good idea

Have you ever used a stroker?  Well I have and boy are they boring, and not that great.  You have to hold it and move it, which I just like normal masterbation.  I mean I don't really need something for that.  Why use a device for a quickie.  My hand is just as good.

But what about positions.  I can remember trying to get a realistic position with my stroker and not really finding any.  You always have to hold it.  Research into this I found that like dildos there are suction cup options, but damn really!  I have to find a spot in the house that will allow a suction cup to hold up a stroker?  No thanks.

I thought 'well shit a medicine ball with a stroker in it would allow me to thrust into it like a woman'.
