So I need to be eating my own dog food right?  Yeah I didn't get it either, but if you wish to understand it keep reading.

Take a look at [the IndieWeb Camp](http://indiewebcamp.com/) and see what they are saying.  They talk about eating you own dog food \([selfdogfooding](http://indiewebcamp.com/selfdogfooding)\), and other such wonderful things, when it comes to the web and you.  They speak about creating a centralized place for your data, that isn't in a company made silo.

This is me offering up what I can do, which isn't much, and offer it to the community.  If you like using [markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and want to build a flat file based blog and note system online, then my offering will not be only for me.

Check out the details below if you are interested...  More to come!
