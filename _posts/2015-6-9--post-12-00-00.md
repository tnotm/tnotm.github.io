I started using Jekyll to make posts to my github pages page/tnotm.com blog thingy... It is technically confusing, I know.

I had created a posting process using [git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29) on the command line, but stopped using it.  It worked for a time but I lost it due to multiple factors.  One being that I am me, and I create and drop projects like a crazy person.

Today I found [Jekyller](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jekyller/lgdhgkhhglmhiacjecigalebiffjklec/related?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog) on the Chrome Web Store.  The app connects to Github and allows you to make new posts and edit old ones.  Pretty darn neat.

Then I realized that I hate the UI.  I have become so used to Material Design I am hating anything else.  So now...

I forked it, but will I make good?

**Update** Yeah I never made good.  Would still love to see this app updated with a metro/material design.
